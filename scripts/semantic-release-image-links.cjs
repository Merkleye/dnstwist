// Appends a "Container Image" section to the notes semantic-release already
// generated from commits. semantic-release concatenates every plugin's
// generateNotes output in plugins-array order, so this just needs to run
// after @semantic-release/release-notes-generator — the result lands in both
// CHANGELOG.md (via @semantic-release/changelog) and the GitHub Release body
// (via @semantic-release/github), since both consume nextRelease.notes.
//
// Tag-based, not digest-based: the per-platform image digest isn't known
// until scripts/release-image.sh actually builds and pushes, which happens
// later in the `prepare` lifecycle step than generateNotes.
//
// Mirrors merkleye/merkleye's scripts/semantic-release-image-links.cjs,
// narrowed to the one image this repo owns.
